# Wiki documentation

## Install instructions

* do not make users add the virtual env activation to their bashrc — then every time they open a terminal they will automatically have the oTree environment which is probably not what they want. Or at least, warn them about what you are doing there. It would be better to include instructions on how to activate the shell without making it the default
* there can be problems with the OS-shipped python under MacOS — perhaps a recommendation for free python distributions like anaconda python or enthought canopy python would be good
* consider making a conda package?
* a bit confusing to have “Setup” in two places — on the first page of the wiki, as well as in the sidebar. They are quite different — perhaps the one on the main page should just link to https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree/wiki/Setup
* Setup steps need to be taken *after* the prerequisites have been done —> on the front page of the wiki this is not the case
* an IDE is not a requirement — some users may prefer not to have one
* is the “setup” wiki page assuming that the user is cloning and installing dependencies with the virtual env activated? This should be made explicit.
