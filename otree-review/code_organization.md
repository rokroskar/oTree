# Code Organization

* requiring that people fork/clone the repo in order to use it is not optimal â€” what happens if a user wants to continue using git for their experiment setup, wants to keep getting updates to the code (i.e. pulling from the original repo) but wants to keep their own experiment design private for whatever reason? Currently the only way of doing this is by some complicated git-fu. Users should be able to use their own directories to set up sessions/experiments etc.
